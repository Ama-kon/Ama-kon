👋 Hi, I'm Amalia Konstantinidou, a female in my 30s living in Germany.
👀 I'm passionate about transitioning from being a self-employed shop owner to pursuing a career in web development.
🌱 Currently, I'm dedicated to learning everything I can to achieve my goal and expand my skill set.
💼 I bring a blend of creativity and a strong will to learn.
💞️ I'm eager to collaborate with others in the web development community to learn and gain experience.
